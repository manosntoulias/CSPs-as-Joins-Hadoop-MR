# CSPs-as-Joins-Hadoop-MR
A few Join algorithms in Hadoop MapReduce that solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems

for more information see:
https://pergamos.lib.uoa.gr/uoa/dl/frontend/file/lib/default/data/1324850/theFile

Hadoop installation is needed (standalone, pseudo-distributed or actual cluster) for the algorithms to execute

Need to set some environmental variables for compilation to work (com.sun.tools.javac.Main)
