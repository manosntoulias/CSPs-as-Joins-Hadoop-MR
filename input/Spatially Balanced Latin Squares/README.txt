FILES ARE ALREADY COMPILED BUT YOU CAN RECOMPILE THEM

produce_data DOESN'T USE HADOOP TO PRODUCE DATA. IT IS BY ITSELF.

FOR THE REST:

MAKE A JAR WITH ALL THE COMPILED(CLASS) FILES.

RUN THE JAR WITH HADOOP. INPUT IS THE NUMBER OF SQUARES.

MAIN CLASS IS IN produce_data_hdfs

e.g
hadoop jar prduce_data.jar produce_data_hdfs 6
